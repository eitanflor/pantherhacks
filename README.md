To explore this map in more detail, navigate to the interactive version by downloading the complete html file [here](https://github.com/eitanflor/pantherhacks/blob/master/Static%20Files/map.html).

Utilizing the completed python script, alongside Neo4j, we can construct a proof-of-concept network for FIU as shown below 

Further applications will involve network analysis and querying to identify possible high risk candidates, aid in contact tracing, and provide risk profiling metrics.
